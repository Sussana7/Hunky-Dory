Before you go through these, check whether your browser zoom is set to 100%.  
I'm saying this because most of the texts look small on my screen. If it’s not, set it to 100% and then go through these.

1. The images folder wasn’t pushed to GitHub. I think it got lost or something.  
Create the `images` folder, put all the images inside, and push it. After that, fix the image imports in your code since the paths will change once the images are moved into the folder.

2. In the CSS, I see you're trying to use the `1rem = 10px` approach, which is nice.  
But you set it like this:  
html {
  font-size: 0.625rem;
}  
Best practice is to use:  
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}  
The first one might give you issues with rem calculations, so it's better to go with the percentage.

3. The navbar looks good, but the "Order Now" button needs a bit of improvement.  
Add some padding and a thin border to make it stand out more.  
Try something like:  
padding: 1.2rem 2.4rem;  
border-radius: 18px;  
border: 1px solid hsl(212, 27%, 19%);  
Also, it's better to use `px` instead of `rem` for `border-radius`.

4. The hero content text looks small. Hero headings are usually the biggest on the page.  
Set the `h1` font size to `9.6rem`.  
Right now, the `width` is 100%, which makes it stretch too far. Change it to `50%` to center it better.  
Also, the line-height is too much by default (around 1.5), so reduce it to `0.95` to tighten up the spacing.  
The subtext (the paragraph) is also small — `2rem` works better.  
Add some space between the paragraph and the heading with `margin-bottom: 3rem`.

5. The call-to-action buttons on the hero section are also small.  
Increase the font size to `2rem` or `1.8rem` and add more padding.  
Also, increase the spacing between the buttons and the hero paragraph.

6. The testimonial texts are very small and hard to read.  
Increase the size of the `h3`, the testimonial paragraph, the name, and the location.  
Also, increase the spacing between the `h3` and the paragraph.  
The spacing between the name/location and the testimonial text should be more than the spacing between the `h3` and the paragraph.

7. We'll fix the footer later, so just leave it for now.
